## S1 - Executive Summary

The intent of the ODC initiative is to collaborate with international organizations to build an ecosystem that efficiently utilyzes the emerging data lakes and uniform metedata catalogs. The EROS activity/effort with repect to ODC initrially focused on a single appliction question regarding ODC libraries supporting LCMAP models and products. With the knowledge garnered from that sucessful test the EROS ODC team is tackling a more general problem of using ODC as part of an arsenal of tools to discover data and immediatly visualize this data in realtime with nothing more than the ubiquitous browser and cloud ready raster imagery and associated metadata.

This Operations Concept document describes the science workflow concept, the associated end-to-end processes, the system components needed to support these flows, the architecture tiers - reference architectures and code/component taxonomy recommended to achieve the intended outcome articulated above.


" It is simply not technically feasible or financially affordable to consider traditional local processing and data distribution methods " - OPEN DATA CUBE (website)


This Concept of Operations covers the scope of work for "The Open Data Cube Special Study" research project for year two of the project and consistent with the larger ODC project this USGS EROS effort has the following high level objectives:

- Minimize time and specialised knowledge required to access and prepare satellite data

- Free and open EO satellite data and application algorithms

- Open source software solutions that are advanced through community contributions

- Consistent data architectures that allow sharing of code, tools and algorithms

- Efficient time series analyses to support land change applications

- Use of multiple datasets together (e.g., interoperability and complementarity)

- Use of common GIS tools (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS) and Libraries (e.g. GDAL/Rasterio, Xarray, STAC, ElasticSearch)

- Local and regional solutions that avoid commercial and internet dependence

- Sustained customer service and user support

### SCOPE
![ODC STAC SCOPE](./assets/drawings/odcstac.png)


The majority of effort for the study will be focused on understanding and deploying prototypes based on the rapidly emerging standards for cloud based storage and exploitation of satellite imagery.

The most significant technical elements are:

1. cloud stored geotifs: **COGs**
2. cloud crawled image catalogs: **STAC**
3. memory stored data-cubes: **Xarrays**

This project is about creating the ecosystem to support science and does not include expertise or opinions on the utility of higher level scientific algorythms/heuristics other than to provide the **Xarray Abstraction** that clearly supports a wide gamut of application workflows including LCMAP continuous change detection models.

The ODC ecosystem elements can be enumerated as follows:

1. Reference Architectures
    - Pangeo
    - REST
    - Operational Concepts and Process Models
2. Infrastructure
    - Storage
    - Compute
    - Network
        - Security
3. Search and Analytics Engine 
    - Elastic Search
    - postgreSQL and OGR
4. Middleware and Foundation Libraries
    - Application Libraries
    - ODC Library
    - Visualization Foundation Libraries
    - GDAL plus Xarray etc.
    - Data Arrays and Data Frames (e.g. Pandas, GeoPandas)
    - Serialized Data and Objects (e.g. json, geoJson, pickle)
    - Data Storage Formats (e.g. geotiff, netCDF)
5. DevOps
    - System Administration
    - Automated System Deployment
        - Infsrastructure as Code
    - Orchestration and Scaling
        - Mesos, Kubernetes, AWS-Lamba, Docker-Swarm
6. Application Prototypes
    - Xarray creation and display notebooks
    - Notional science notebooks
    - Image Discovery Browsers
    - Coverage Maps and Scene Counts (by: year,month)
    - Visualizations
        - Swaths, Scenes, AOIs
        - Pixel Level
        - Pixel QA Plots
        - Pixel Rods (time axis)
        - Indices (e.g. NDVI, NDWI etc)
7. Coordination and Communication
    - code sharing & repository management
    - hackathon and sprint management
    - steering and governance




### History


#### Year 1 ODC Study Emphasis - LCMAP case study

![year one](./assets/drawings/year1.png)

The ODC Special Study project at EROS concluded the first year with a focus on examining the relationship between LCMAP and the ODC architecture/library. This was as good a place as any to observe the ODC in action and understand the end-to-end process activities needed to actively prototype the use of ODC as middleware in support of LCMAP model and product generation. EROS learned a ton by particpatingin this larger ODC community and at the same time focusing on one of EROS's main efforts to use Landsat data to assess and predict land change.

This effort was not hypothetical or theoretical but rather emphirical.

The hard and often arduous tasks included the following:
1. Creating data lakes on top of local and cloud data storage with multiple processing levels and multiple metadata types
2. Setting up and populating database stores for indexed metadata
3. Writing software tools from scratch to manage end-to-end data curation from data portals to converted geotifs [COGs]


The following conclusions were formed:

1. ODC is a great prototyping environment
2. ODC is a premier instance of the new PANGEO reference architecture
3. LCMAP pyccd input pixel-rods can be easily sliced from an Xarray
4. The risks of running LCMAP in the cloud are almost nil
5. The cloud will rapidly shift the way applications are run and minimize infrastructure waste while at the same time delivering impressive time to solution metrics. 
6. The ODC community represents and important arena for discussing and implementing Landsat higher level products.
7. The browser is the best place for the user interface for future GIS applications.


#### Year 2 ODC Study Emphasis

The ODC Special Study project at EROS concluded the first year with a focus on examining the relationship between LCMAP and the ODC architecture/library. This was as good a place as any to view the 


## Introduction

_"The goal of land-change science is to determine changes in the type, intensity, condition, and location of land use and cover as indications of possible impacts to and from the interactions between people and nature." LCMAP -- ConOps_

**Object storage traversal with metadata organized via STAC will prevail**

The goal of this effort is to support land-change science as well as a myriad of other application use-cases from a disceptively simple cloud storage model.

Use AWS S3 and store:
1. COGs
2. A STAC catalog of metadata to refernce the above COGs

This data and metadata can them be exploited in highly scalable distributed wasy with minimal code and maximum utility with the most common of tools, components and programming languages.

The momentum and rapid discoveries in this emerging model are proving to be revolutionary. Some existing applications reference pointers to each of the work flow items will be document as part of this "living Operations Concept". 

The system proposed will meet the following data user objectives:

1. Real-time exploration of live Satellite image through time and the ability to:
    - Visulaize many band combinations
    - Compute commin indexes real time
2. Rapidly construct customize, personalized data cubes
    - Selected Area of Interest
    - Selected Date Range
    - Automated and Manual Data Pruning of "ugly" data
3. Support an obvious transition for small scale ad-hoc algorythm development to embarrassingly parallel execution at continental scale.
4. Many, Many to be discovered uses of the STAC/COG ecosystem.
