# Development Seed Intersections

## Objective

## Outline

1. Recap of the week - What was the best Session?
    - What collaborations make sense Renee?
2. Annual Plans
    - Release of "the prototype/raft" application code in gethub?
    - ODC Conference in February
        - If the Trump Shutdown does not occur
3. ODC and DevelopmentSeed should be complementary
4. Demonstrations and Discussions
5. What elements will thrive? (cool technologies with staying power)

## What things are Cool?

1. AWS is cool!
2. S3 is cool!
3. elastic computing is cool
4. 


**more**

1. COGS are cool!
2. Xarrays are cool!
3. 


**more**

1. GDAL is cool!
2. OGR is cool (maybe)
3. JSON?
4. teraform/cloud formation

## What things are NOT Cool?

1. big balls of mud
2. persistent, proprietary databases (at least in the cloud)
3. jpeg2000


## DevelopmenSeed Greenhouse and the ODC SandBox
1. ODC sandbox is being created now.


## Applications and Teams

### AMA - Job description

``` This team develops applications on top of xarrays; and visits underpriviledged countries ```

The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS – ceos.org) supports  the Open Data Cube (ODC – opendatacube.org) initiative:

   - To provide a  future data architecture solution that harnesses the power of Earth  Observation (EO) satellite data for societal benefit. 

   - The ODC is an  open-source analytics platform that manages satellite data. **Analytical  Mechanics and Associates** (AMA) in Hampton, VA has worked extensively  with CEOS through the NASA (nasa.gov) CEOS Systems Engineering Office  (SEO) to develop cutting-edge technologies and analysis capabilities for  the international space-based Earth observation community. 

   - Due to the  efforts of this group, CEOS is uniquely able to provide substantial  contributions to the ODC and to support global implementations. 

   - Leverage scientific computing (and data science) to address global  problems like food security, and issues related to agriculture,  deforestation, and water access.
   - Work on our CEOS Data Cube User Interface, currently built using Python & Django
   - Work on our data processing pipeline, which currently uses Python and AWS

### GeoScience Australia

 Harnessing the Power of Satellite Data

       ONE PIXEL AT A TIME

       Upcoming Events

       February 2019

       3rd Open Data Cube Conference

       Venue: Geoscience Australia, CSIRO

1. Open Data Cube Core provides:

   1.  an integrated gridded data analysis environment for decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite and related data

   2.  from **multiple** satellite and other acquisition systems.

   3. Open Data Cube grew out of the Data Cube software for Digital Earth Australia (DEA) (AGDC) that runs on premise on "big iron"


### Others USGS, Catapult, CSIRO, CEOS, United Nations



## Xarray

## Metadata Handling

1. json, xml, MTL
2. persistent databases vs. web scraping
   1. ad-hoc AOI versus continental scale projects
   2. STAC
3. What techniques does DevelopmentSeed use and plan to use?

## Migrating legacy to Cloud Native

## Demonstrations
