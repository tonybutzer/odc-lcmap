## Practical Implications

The above steps were necessary to understand the entire ODC landscape, evaluate ODC's components and develop strategies and tactics that help accelerate EROS cloud developments. Additionally, these activities allow us to establish common context among the development groups in L2PGS, LSAA, ODC and Development Seed to blend the concepts when designing data exploitation schemes for the cloud.

## Findings

1. ODC strategy
   1. promote ODC as a tool and library
   2. explore lcmap and ODC intersections
      1. empirically test ODC-LCMAP in the cloud
         1. much progress made here already
   3. understand ODC as a service
   4. help improve the ODC code base
   5. participate in the ODC leadership forums
      1. Partners Forum - Steve Labahn
      2. 
   6. find practical uses for ODC at EROS
   7. train/evangelize/advocate ODC as a set of capabilities inside EROS
      1. Build cloud instances of ODC to point at test data
         1. CA DevSeed dataset
      2. Build a LSAA/LPIP Cross Functional Team
         1. Charter
            1. Staff = Renee, tim M. Jonathan Hedman and others
      3. Use ODC as a vehicle for discovery
         1. metadata QA
         2. Data (time-series) QA
         3. COG recipe definition and evaluation
         4. Technology Tinder/selection and exploitation
2. lcmap section
   1. stay the course
   2. plenty of time to integrate 
3. test assets - now
